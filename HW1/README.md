CSPP51050
Homework 1
Sam Henry

I solved HW 1 using Smalltalk. I wrote in Squeak in order to make extend TestCase for unit testing in Squeak's TestRunner. My unit tests also work if you filein to Pharo.

Download one-click images:
	Squeak: http://ftp.squeak.org/4.4/Squeak-4.4-All-in-One.zip
	Pharo: 	http://www.pharo-project.org/pharo-download 

My solutions' classes have been filed out to two files:
	CSPP51050-HW1.st
	CSPP51050-HW1-Tests.st

If you filein these files to your Squeak or Pharo using the File Browser, you'll see the following classes:

	Registrar
	Course
	RegistrarTests
	CourseTests

I've implemented the functionality in Registrar and Course, and included unit tests in RegistrarTests and CourseTests. You may browse the source for each class and run the unit tests using Squeak's TestRunner or by action-clicking on CSPP51050-HW1-Tests --> Run Tests in Pharo.
