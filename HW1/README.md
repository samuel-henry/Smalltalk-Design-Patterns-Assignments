CSPP51050
Homework 1
Sam Henry

I solved HW 1 using Smalltalk. 

My solutions' classes have been output to two files:
	CSPP51050-HW1.st
	CSPP51050-HW1-Tests.st

If you filein these files to your favorite Smalltalk implementation (I wrote in Squeak, but have also tested in Pharo) using the File Browser, you'll see the following classes:

	Registrar
	Course
	RegistrarTests
	CourseTests

I've implemented the functionality in Registrar and Course, and included unit tests in RegistrarTests and CourseTests. You may browse the source for each class and run the unit tests using Squeak's TestRunner or by action-clicking on CSPP51050-HW1-Tests --> Run Tests in Pharo.
