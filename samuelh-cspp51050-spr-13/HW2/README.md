SPP51050
HW2
Sam Henry

I solved both HW2 problems using Smalltalk. I wrote in Squeak in order to extend TestCase for unit testing in Squeak's TestRunner. My unit tests also work if you filein to Pharo.

My solutions' classes have been filed out to two files:
	CSPP51050-HW2-Problem1.st
        CSPP51050-HW2-Problem2.st
	CSPP51050-HW2-Problem1-Tests.st
	CSPP51050-HW2-Problem2-Tests.st

If you filein these files to your Squeak or Pharo using the File Browser, you'll see my solution's classes.

Please browse the source for each class and run the unit tests using Squeak's TestRunner or by action-clicking on CSPP51050-HW2-Problem1-Tests/CSPP51050-HW2-Problem2-Tests --> Run Tests in Pharo.
